# Game Classifier using EfficientNetB3

This project uses an EfficientNetB3 model to classify images of different games.

## 📂 Folder Structure
- `game_classifier_model.h5`: Trained EfficientNetB3 model
- `dataset/`: Labeled game images
- `efficienyNetB.ipynb`: Model training notebook

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/game-classifier.git
   cd game-classifier
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the Jupyter Notebook to train or test the model.

## 📊 Model Accuracy
The model was trained on four game classes and achieved high accuracy during testing.
